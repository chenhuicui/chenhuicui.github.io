I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST). 

My research interest include software engineering (SE), software testing, and AI for SE.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rubing Huang](https://huangrubing.github.io/) of M.U.S.T. AI+SE Lab from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST).
