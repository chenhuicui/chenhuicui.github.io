I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://fie.must.edu.mo/page/id-1434.html?locale=en_US), [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/index.html?locale=en_US). My research interests include software engineering (SE), software testing, and AI for SE.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rubing Huang](https://huangrubing.github.io/) of M.U.S.T. AI+SE Lab from the School of Computer Science and, Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST).
